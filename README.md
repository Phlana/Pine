# Pine

rpg with turn based combat using pygame

jk pygame is really slow im switching to pyglet


    inspired by the Golden Sun series for the GBA


storywriter needed

map maker needed

sprite artist needed






    could probably do everything myself but would take much longer
    also i suck at art
